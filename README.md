# FCNPC

FCNPC is a plugin where you can create controllable NPCs in your server! It is similar to the plugin CNPC (for old SA-MP members) but very different in code, and is supported to the latest SA-MP server version (0.3z-R4 as of now.)

## Credits

OrMisicL - Whole plugin, he is the original author!
Emci_Funtik - 0.3z-R4 support!
Lorenc_/Chris42O - Updating the memory addresses regularly!
MyU - Sharp intelligent mind!

## Why this is made

I like to update the memory addresses, and this plugin is used moderately in one my community servers therefore I have no choice to update this if I want to update my community server.

The original GitHub page is inactive, and this is intended to help keep the plugin active. (original: https://github.com/OrMisicL/FCNPC)

## Notes

There could be issues with XP users running this plugin as I compiled it with VS13
